    "Powers": "Unique Physiology: Due to his chemical submergence, Joker gained beyond average advantages over normal humans as well as further exposure tainting his physiology.\nPain Resistance: It was speculated that the Joker's exposure to chemicals may have heightened his resistance to pain. It was also implied that he was masochistic in nature, and thus enjoyed any pain received, making it an ineffective way of dealing with him.\nTainted Blood: Joker's blood was tainted. It was said that \"being an avid consumer of his products, Joker's immunity to poisons has been built up over years of dedicated abuse.\" When a mosquito sucked the Joker's blood, it \"writhes and whines, choking on tainted blood\".[44]\nToxic Immunity: The Joker was immune to his own venom as well as various similar toxins.\nCheating Death: The Joker cheated death numerous times, even in seemingly inescapable and lethal situations. He has been, among other things, caught in explosions, electrocuted, shot repeatedly, and dropped from great heights, but he always returns to once again wreak havoc.\nCosmic Awareness: The Joker has, at times, shown to be fully aware of being a comic book character, even directly talking to the reader. However, most other characters ignore this, believing it to be a manifestation of his insanity.\nOmnipotence (Formerly)[45]",
    "Description": "The Joker is a homicidal maniac and the archenemy of Batman. His real name and origin are unknown, but one of the most common versions indicates that he fell into a vat of chemicals which turned his skin white and his hair green. Completely unpredictable with no regard for human life, the Joker finds murder and mayhem funny, and is perhaps the most dangerous man on Earth with a body count stretching into the thousands, all centered around his obsession with the Batman.\n",

Being a living, breathing incubator for the affliction, Mr. Ikarus can manipulate his body in unique ways in order to replicate the powers, skills or equipment function of whomever or whatever he is mimicking at will.[5]\nPower Replication: The Amazo Virus gave Patient Zero the ability to mimic every power he came into visual contact with. He does it by mutating his body accordingly to the ability he's replicating, evolving with every enemy he encounters.[2]\nHeat Vision: An ability he gained by watching Superman's eyes, he concentrates great amounts of heat before releasing them through his optical nerves.[2]\nElectrokinesis: Copied from Shazam, able to discharge bolts of lightning from his hands at will.[4]\nGreen Emotional Energy: Amazo had can emulate the energies of the emotion spectrum, harnessing green light for blasts and energy constructs fired from his clenched fists.[6]\nMetamorphosis: Amazo's body had been altered in a great many ways from the original anatomic structure of its host. It also used this function to spontaneously alternate his biology in order to produce new functions for newfound powers he'd acquire.\nWings: An attribute he gained by watching Superman hover, he grows a pair of bat-like wings on his back that allows him to fly at high speeds.[2]\nFlight: These wings allow him to fly at high speeds, much like Superman.[2]\nArm-Cannon: A weapon he gained by watching Lex Luthor's battle suit gun, he grows a series of cannons on his forearm that shoot powerful beams of energy.[4]\nSuperhuman Strength: Even without the need of replicating it, Patient Zero already possesses vast levels of strength. Tearing his way through an entire city[1] and clashing against the likes of Superman.[2]\nSuperhuman Durability: He could endure hits from both Superman and Wonder Woman without visible injury.[2]\nInfection: As the virus' living incubator, he can spread the disease airborne in order to contaminate every human it encounters.[1]\nPower Distribution: Through the virus Armen could bestow as well as control the unique powers bestowed upon the individually afflicted, powers granted manifest via subconscious desires or psychological characteristics right before infection kills its host.[1]\nPower Dilution: As with the original Virus, Amazo can dampen if not outright negate the superhuman abilities of infected metahumans at will. As was the case with the afflicted Justice League as well as the assailant Neutron.[4]\nTelepathy: Patient Zero has the ability to mentally communicate with all of those who were infected by the Amazo Virus.[3]\nMind Control: He can consciously manipulate the minds of the infected in order to work as a hive mind of sorts.[4]",

    "City": "Alexander Luthor, Jr.",
    "Powers": "New God Physiology: As a New God, Darkseid exists outside of normal time and space. The New Gods have evolved into beings of genetic stability and evolutionary perfection, due to taking up the powers of other gods and their close proximity to the Source. Darkseid's \"True Form\" or \"Godhead\" (which is the Multiversal Entity of pure evil that all versions and forms of Darkseid embody) however, was fragmented into a lesser form after Final Crisis, until he eventually reconstituted into his \"True Form\", which consisted of all of Darkseid's lesser forms, making all of his past aspects become one. In this True Form, Darkseid states his power exceeds what it was before the first Crisis.[24]\nEnhanced Intellect: Darkseid's mental capacity far exceeds that of a normal human. He's been described as being a hundred steps up the evolutionary ladder from humans.[25]\nImmortality: Darkseid is functionally immortal, having ceased aging physically when he received his power.[3]\nInvulnerability: Darkseid survived the destruction of a whole planet,[3] remained unfazed by the combined assault of the Justice League,[13] and was completely unharmed by the God-killing Boom-Spheres.[7] It took the combined power of the entire Multiverse's Green to knock him out.[20]\nEnergy Resistance: Darkseid is highly resistant to most energy based attacks. Even while in a weakened state, he was unfazed by both Cyborg's arm cannon and Azrael's flaming Murasame sword.[26]\nRegeneration: Darkseid was able to regenerate his eyesight after both his eyes were impaled by Wonder Woman and Aquaman.[13]\nSuperhuman Speed: Darkseid is able to move at speeds far greater than any human. Even when not at full power, Darkseid was still fast enough to match Zeus' combat speed. During this fight, Wonder Woman stated she had never seen a battle happen at the speed they were fighting at.[27]\nSuperhuman Stamina: Darkseid fought against Highfather Izaya for seven days straight, showing only minor signs of fatigue.[5]\nSuperhuman Strength: Darkseid's strength rivals a Kryptonian's.[3] He is capable of effortlessly shattering Lantern constructs,[12] defeating multiple superhumans simultaneously,[13] [19] and temporarily holding his own against a Multiverse-empowered Green Lantern.[20] Darkseid was even strong enough to hold open portals from closing, using only his bare hands.[3]\nOmega Effect: Darkseid wields a cosmic energy field called the \"Omega Effect\", which proves integral, as it is the core from which his other abilities manifest from. He can manipulate this powerful energy field to traverse time and space, among other abilities.\nOmega Beams: Darkseid can fire concentrated beams from his eyes which can lock on its target to ensure it never misses. He has pinpoint control over these Omega Beams, and his unerring aim allows it to travel in straight lines or bend, twist or curve around corners. The beams are powerful enough to harm Kryptonians,[12] destroy planets,[3] and are fast enough to catch speedsters.[12] Anything Darkseid destroys with them can be recreated with but a thought.[citation needed]\nDisintegration[28]\nCosmic Awareness: Darkseid can perceive and understand the workings of the universe on a cosmic level. He is able to perceive others even in different dimensions.[29]\nDarkness Manipulation: In his True Form, Darkseid is able to generate and manipulate a powerful dark energy that was capable of seemingly killing the entire Quintessence.[24]\nDimensional Travel: Darkseid's Omega Effect allows him to transverse through time and space at will,[3] allowing him to cross between dimensions.[30]\nBoomtube Projection: Darkseid is able to create and project Boomtubes at will, either for his own use or to send others to desired destinations without requiring the use of a Mother Box.[29]\nErosion Blasts: Darkseid can focus his Omega energy through his hands and arms to generate eradicating shockwaves to destroy the surrounding landscape.[11]\nFlight: Darkseid is capable of levitating and flying at will.[7]\nGravity Manipulation: When Darkseid reached between universes, his hand created an immense gravitational pull that twisted time and space in his surrounding area.[31]\nChronokinesis: Darkseid's gravitational pull was so strong that it warped time itself in the surrounding area. When John Constantine was trapped within it, he stated he lived days between each second from his perception.[31]\nPower Absorption: Darkseid can absorb the life-force of Old Gods to regain strength. He was able to absorb the power of Zeus in order to get back to full strength.[27] He was also able to feed on the energy of Zeus' children to regain power.[32]\nResurrection: Darkseid can seemingly revitalize those who've been dead for some time as seen by his having been able to resurrect a long since deceased Steppenwolf, last seen within his personal chambers.[9]\nSize Alteration: Darkseid can adjust his size at will, as seen by his having once stretched an enlarged hand towards refugees from Earth 2 when Constantine tried to ferry them to safety in another universe.[29]\nSummoning: Darkseid has the unique ability to summon the Black Racer to aid him in battle. He also has complete control over the entity.[23]\nTelepathy: Darkseid is able to telepathically invade the minds of others, even while in a separate dimension.[29]\nApokolips Power Feed: Darkseid can replenish his lost strength by sealing himself in the heart of Apokolips and \"eating\" the planet's energy. Doing so, however, is a risk since Darkseid is unable to get free until the replenishment is complete and the draining can accelerate Apokolips' withering process.[7]",

When Aquarius had his powers reduced, he was simply a sentient star until he obtained the Cosmic Rod. Using the device, he was somehow able to restore himself to possibly his full potential.\nHypnotism: Enough to control all of the JSA.\nEnergy Construct Creation: He could animate neon-figures.\nFlight\nDeflection: Reflected blasts are increased.\nPower Distribution: He could temporarily increase the strength of a 4-year old child to superhuman levels.\nInvulnerability: He could withstand Superman's punches without any damage.\nSuperhuman Reflexes: He could easily dodge Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth.\nWeather Manipulation: He could turn fire into rain.\nPyrokinesis: He could emit star-like heat.\nSize Alteration\nAquarius could endow the Cosmic Rod's energy blasts with magical nature, which are extremely destructive to those susceptible to magic, such as Kryptonians.\nAquarius could also block Dimensional Travel to a specific dimension by creating a space-warp.\nEnergy Projection: In possession of the Cosmic Rod, Aquarius could cover himself with a yellow aura and could project it as a radiation-based energy sphere. Although affecting only one target at a time, its radiation, even at a distance, is lethal to humans in the long term. It was responsible for the first Black Canary's death from cancer years after their fight.[1] It depletes Cosmic Rod's energy, which will be only restored after one week; all other effects from his powers will be cancelled, including banished persons with dimensional travel.\nDimensional Travel: In possession of the Cosmic Rod, Aquarius had significant power to banish Earth's population from the Earth-Two universe. It depletes Cosmic Rod's energy, which will be only restored after one week.[2]",

    "Powers": "Kryptonian Physiology: Under the effects of a \"yellow\" sun, Az-Rel possesses the same potential powers as an average Kryptonian. These include:\nSolar Energy Absorption: Under optimal conditions, this is the main source of Az-Rel's super powers as they are contingent upon exposure to solar radiation from a yellow sun star system. His biological make up includes a number of organs which lack analogues in humans and whose functions are unknown. It is believed that between one or more of these and his bio-cellular matrix, \"yellow\" solar energy is stored for later use. This allows for the use of these powers to fade when yellow solar radiation is not available instead of immediate failure.\nHeat Vision: Az-Rel can, as a conscious act, fire beams of intense heat at a target by looking at it. He can vary the heat and area affected.\nSuper-Hearing: Az-Rel's hearing is sensitive enough to hear any sound at any volume or pitch. With skill and concentration, he can block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source or frequency.\nEnhanced Vision: Az-Rel's vision processes the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as allowing vast control over selective perception and focus.This umbrella ability includes the following:\nElectromagnetic Spectrum Vision: Az-Rel can see well into most of the electromagnetic spectrum. He can see and identify radio and television signals as well as all other broadcast or transmitted frequencies. Using this ability, he can avoid detection by radar or satellite monitoring methods. This also allows him to see the aura generated by living thing.\nTelescopic Vision: This is the ability to see something at a great distance, without violating the laws of physics. Though limited, the exact extent of the ability is undetermined. In function, it is similar to the zoom lens on a camera.\nX-Ray Vision: This is the ability to see through any volume of matter except lead. Az-Rels can see things behind a solid, opaque object as if it were not there. He can focus this ability to \"peel back\" layers of an object, allowing hidden image or inner workings to be observed. The exact type of energy perceived—such as x-rays, cosmic rays, or some other energy invisible to normal humans—is unclear. This ability perceives an ambient energy source though, it does not involve the eye projecting a concentrated, possibly toxic, beam to be reflected back from objects.\nMicroscopic Vision: This is the ability to see extremely small objects and images down to the atomic level.\nInfrared Vision: Az-Rel can see with better acuity in darkness, and to a degree in total darkness.\nFlight: Az-Rel is able to manipulate graviton particles to defy the forces of gravity and achieve flight. This ranges from hovering to moving in any posture, in any direction.\nInvulnerability: Due to the interaction of his dense molecular structure and supercharged bio-electric aura, Az-Rel is nigh-invulnerable to extreme energy forces. In addition, his extends this protection against toxins and diseases.\nSuperhuman Stamina: Az-Rel is able to maintain continuous strenuous physical action for an indefinite period of time. This based on his body converting yellow solar radiation directly to energy, but is limited by physiological and psychological needs to eat, drink, and sleep.\nSuperhuman Strength: Az-Rel's strength is augmented by yellow solar radiation interacting with the greater than human density, resilience and biological efficiency of his musculature. His strength is more an act of conscious will on energy fields than actual physical strength. It is this act of conscious will that enables him to perform physical feats that are beyond the mere application force, such as moving a mountain top without said rock crumbling under its own mass.\nSuperhuman Speed: Az-Rel is able to move at incredible speed by sheer force of will. This extends to his perceptions and allows for feats such as catching bullets in mid flight as well as covering vast distances in little or no time.This also confers:\nSuperhuman Agility\nSuperhuman Reflexes\nSuper-Breath: Az-Rel is able to create hurricane force winds by exhaling air from his lungs. He can chill the air as it leaves his lungs to freeze targets. He can also reverse the process to pull large volumes of air or vapor into his  lungs.\nLongevity: Az-Rel can live longer than regular humans, remaining at his prime as long as he was under the exposure of the \"yellow\" sun.",

After her tryst with the witch Circe, Barbara could willingly change to and back from human form and animal form at will.\nSuperhuman Strength: As an avatar of a god, Cheetah possesses great strength.\nSuperhuman Durability: Cheetah's physical durability is enough to withstand blows from the likes of Wonder Woman and Superman. Cheetah's durability doesn't protect her from bullets, lasers, or other piercing attacks.\nSuperhuman Speed: Cheetah possesses greater speed than Wonder Woman, enhanced even further by training with Zoom.[6] When Cheetah over came her psychological blocks, she managed to acquire her true speed.[6][7]\nSuperhuman Agility: Cheetah's agility is enhanced far beyond normal human levels.\nEnhanced Senses: Cheetah's senses are a lot more powerful than a normal human.\nClaws and Fangs: Cheetah's claws and fangs are enchanted and allow her to cut almost anything.
