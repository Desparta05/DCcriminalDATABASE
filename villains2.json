  "HairColor": "Green",
  "City": "Arkham Asylum",
  "Powers": "Unique Physiology: Due to his chemical submergence, Joker gained beyond average advantages over normal humans as well as further exposure tainting his physiology.\nPain Resistance: It was speculated that the Joker's exposure to chemicals may have heightened his resistance to pain. It was also implied that he was masochistic in nature, and thus enjoyed any pain received, making it an ineffective way of dealing with him.\nTainted Blood: Joker's blood was tainted. It was said that \"being an avid consumer of his products, Joker's immunity to poisons has been built up over years of dedicated abuse.\" When a mosquito sucked the Joker's blood, it \"writhes and whines, choking on tainted blood\".[44]\nToxic Immunity: The Joker was immune to his own venom as well as various similar toxins.\nCheating Death: The Joker cheated death numerous times, even in seemingly inescapable and lethal situations. He has been, among other things, caught in explosions, electrocuted, shot repeatedly, and dropped from great heights, but he always returns to once again wreak havoc.\nCosmic Awareness: The Joker has, at times, shown to be fully aware of being a comic book character, even directly talking to the reader. However, most other characters ignore this, believing it to be a manifestation of his insanity.\nOmnipotence (Formerly)[45]",
  "Description": "The Joker is a homicidal maniac and the archenemy of Batman. His real name and origin are unknown, but one of the most common versions indicates that he fell into a vat of chemicals which turned his skin white and his hair green. Completely unpredictable with no regard for human life, the Joker finds murder and mayhem funny, and is perhaps the most dangerous man on Earth with a body count stretching into the thousands, all centered around his obsession with the Batman.\n",

Being a living, breathing incubator for the affliction, Mr. Ikarus can manipulate his body in unique ways in order to replicate the powers, skills or equipment function of whomever or whatever he is mimicking at will.[5]\nPower Replication: The Amazo Virus gave Patient Zero the ability to mimic every power he came into visual contact with. He does it by mutating his body accordingly to the ability he's replicating, evolving with every enemy he encounters.[2]\nHeat Vision: An ability he gained by watching Superman's eyes, he concentrates great amounts of heat before releasing them through his optical nerves.[2]\nElectrokinesis: Copied from Shazam, able to discharge bolts of lightning from his hands at will.[4]\nGreen Emotional Energy: Amazo had can emulate the energies of the emotion spectrum, harnessing green light for blasts and energy constructs fired from his clenched fists.[6]\nMetamorphosis: Amazo's body had been altered in a great many ways from the original anatomic structure of its host. It also used this function to spontaneously alternate his biology in order to produce new functions for newfound powers he'd acquire.\nWings: An attribute he gained by watching Superman hover, he grows a pair of bat-like wings on his back that allows him to fly at high speeds.[2]\nFlight: These wings allow him to fly at high speeds, much like Superman.[2]\nArm-Cannon: A weapon he gained by watching Lex Luthor's battle suit gun, he grows a series of cannons on his forearm that shoot powerful beams of energy.[4]\nSuperhuman Strength: Even without the need of replicating it, Patient Zero already possesses vast levels of strength. Tearing his way through an entire city[1] and clashing against the likes of Superman.[2]\nSuperhuman Durability: He could endure hits from both Superman and Wonder Woman without visible injury.[2]\nInfection: As the virus' living incubator, he can spread the disease airborne in order to contaminate every human it encounters.[1]\nPower Distribution: Through the virus Armen could bestow as well as control the unique powers bestowed upon the individually afflicted, powers granted manifest via subconscious desires or psychological characteristics right before infection kills its host.[1]\nPower Dilution: As with the original Virus, Amazo can dampen if not outright negate the superhuman abilities of infected metahumans at will. As was the case with the afflicted Justice League as well as the assailant Neutron.[4]\nTelepathy: Patient Zero has the ability to mentally communicate with all of those who were infected by the Amazo Virus.[3]\nMind Control: He can consciously manipulate the minds of the infected in order to work as a hive mind of sorts.[4]",

  "City": "Alexander Luthor, Jr.",
  "Powers": "New God Physiology: As a New God, Darkseid exists outside of normal time and space. The New Gods have evolved into beings of genetic stability and evolutionary perfection, due to taking up the powers of other gods and their close proximity to the Source. Darkseid's \"True Form\" or \"Godhead\" (which is the Multiversal Entity of pure evil that all versions and forms of Darkseid embody) however, was fragmented into a lesser form after Final Crisis, until he eventually reconstituted into his \"True Form\", which consisted of all of Darkseid's lesser forms, making all of his past aspects become one. In this True Form, Darkseid states his power exceeds what it was before the first Crisis.[24]\nEnhanced Intellect: Darkseid's mental capacity far exceeds that of a normal human. He's been described as being a hundred steps up the evolutionary ladder from humans.[25]\nImmortality: Darkseid is functionally immortal, having ceased aging physically when he received his power.[3]\nInvulnerability: Darkseid survived the destruction of a whole planet,[3] remained unfazed by the combined assault of the Justice League,[13] and was completely unharmed by the God-killing Boom-Spheres.[7] It took the combined power of the entire Multiverse's Green to knock him out.[20]\nEnergy Resistance: Darkseid is highly resistant to most energy based attacks. Even while in a weakened state, he was unfazed by both Cyborg's arm cannon and Azrael's flaming Murasame sword.[26]\nRegeneration: Darkseid was able to regenerate his eyesight after both his eyes were impaled by Wonder Woman and Aquaman.[13]\nSuperhuman Speed: Darkseid is able to move at speeds far greater than any human. Even when not at full power, Darkseid was still fast enough to match Zeus' combat speed. During this fight, Wonder Woman stated she had never seen a battle happen at the speed they were fighting at.[27]\nSuperhuman Stamina: Darkseid fought against Highfather Izaya for seven days straight, showing only minor signs of fatigue.[5]\nSuperhuman Strength: Darkseid's strength rivals a Kryptonian's.[3] He is capable of effortlessly shattering Lantern constructs,[12] defeating multiple superhumans simultaneously,[13] [19] and temporarily holding his own against a Multiverse-empowered Green Lantern.[20] Darkseid was even strong enough to hold open portals from closing, using only his bare hands.[3]\nOmega Effect: Darkseid wields a cosmic energy field called the \"Omega Effect\", which proves integral, as it is the core from which his other abilities manifest from. He can manipulate this powerful energy field to traverse time and space, among other abilities.\nOmega Beams: Darkseid can fire concentrated beams from his eyes which can lock on its target to ensure it never misses. He has pinpoint control over these Omega Beams, and his unerring aim allows it to travel in straight lines or bend, twist or curve around corners. The beams are powerful enough to harm Kryptonians,[12] destroy planets,[3] and are fast enough to catch speedsters.[12] Anything Darkseid destroys with them can be recreated with but a thought.[citation needed]\nDisintegration[28]\nCosmic Awareness: Darkseid can perceive and understand the workings of the universe on a cosmic level. He is able to perceive others even in different dimensions.[29]\nDarkness Manipulation: In his True Form, Darkseid is able to generate and manipulate a powerful dark energy that was capable of seemingly killing the entire Quintessence.[24]\nDimensional Travel: Darkseid's Omega Effect allows him to transverse through time and space at will,[3] allowing him to cross between dimensions.[30]\nBoomtube Projection: Darkseid is able to create and project Boomtubes at will, either for his own use or to send others to desired destinations without requiring the use of a Mother Box.[29]\nErosion Blasts: Darkseid can focus his Omega energy through his hands and arms to generate eradicating shockwaves to destroy the surrounding landscape.[11]\nFlight: Darkseid is capable of levitating and flying at will.[7]\nGravity Manipulation: When Darkseid reached between universes, his hand created an immense gravitational pull that twisted time and space in his surrounding area.[31]\nChronokinesis: Darkseid's gravitational pull was so strong that it warped time itself in the surrounding area. When John Constantine was trapped within it, he stated he lived days between each second from his perception.[31]\nPower Absorption: Darkseid can absorb the life-force of Old Gods to regain strength. He was able to absorb the power of Zeus in order to get back to full strength.[27] He was also able to feed on the energy of Zeus' children to regain power.[32]\nResurrection: Darkseid can seemingly revitalize those who've been dead for some time as seen by his having been able to resurrect a long since deceased Steppenwolf, last seen within his personal chambers.[9]\nSize Alteration: Darkseid can adjust his size at will, as seen by his having once stretched an enlarged hand towards refugees from Earth 2 when Constantine tried to ferry them to safety in another universe.[29]\nSummoning: Darkseid has the unique ability to summon the Black Racer to aid him in battle. He also has complete control over the entity.[23]\nTelepathy: Darkseid is able to telepathically invade the minds of others, even while in a separate dimension.[29]\nApokolips Power Feed: Darkseid can replenish his lost strength by sealing himself in the heart of Apokolips and \"eating\" the planet's energy. Doing so, however, is a risk since Darkseid is unable to get free until the replenishment is complete and the draining can accelerate Apokolips' withering process.[7]",

Martians can easily shatter reinforced concrete and steel, lift and carry houndreds of tons with ease and deliver incredible damage with their blows.[4]\nSuperhuman Stamina\nSuperhuman Durability: Martians possess high levels of durability that make them nigh-invulnerable to all forms of damage. Martians can withstand high caliber bullets, powerful energy blast and kinetic impacts without suffering damage.[5]\nSuperhuman Speed: Martians can process thoughts, move, and react at incredible speed, being able to cover vast distances in little or no time, catch bullets in mid flight, run on water and create afterimages as they run.[6]\nSuperhuman Agility\nSuperhuman Reflexes\nRegeneration: Martians have powerful regenerative powers that enable them to regenerate their entire body from a severed limb, they can furtherly enhance their regenerative powers by drawing mass from nearby sources.[7]\nFlight[3]\nExtrasensory Input\nLongevity[7]\nSuper Hearing[7]\nHeat Vision[8]\nMartian Vision: Martian visual acuity greatly exceed human norms and allows for a wider range of information to be observed.

They can also project their mental essences into a gestalt community known as the \"Great Mind\". Through this, the community can enhance the telepathic strength of other Martians. This power can also enable them to reverse the effects of amnesia or psychological brainwashing. [3]\nIllusions\nPossession\nAstral Projection\nMind Control: As an extension of this, Martians can also use the ability to alter a psychological profile of a target, enabling them to manipulate, and in some cases, outright control that individual. This practice is greatly discouraged however, and only rarely used. [11]\nTelepathic Relay[11]\nTelepathic Assault\nTelekinesis[12]: Martians have mind-over-matter abilities and can lift and move objects with their minds. They can also employ their telekinesis in offensive way by discharging telekinetic blasts capable of great concussive power.[13]",

This allows them to a form of shape-shifting that allows them to mimic other forms, elongate aspects of their body, increase or decrease their physical size, and so on.\nSize Alteration: As an extension of their shape-shifting abilities martians can alter their size with ease, being able to shrink or grow to gigantic size.[1]\nInvisibility: Martians can cause the biopolymers in their bodies to lose their ability to reflect light, making the Martians invisible to normal light and human sight.[2]\nPhasing: Martians can go through solid matter.\nSuperhuman Strength[2]: Martians possess vast levels of superhuman strength and are among the few races that are able to match Kryptonians in terms of raw strength. Martians can easily shatter reinforced concrete and steel, lift and carry houndreds of tons with ease and deliver incredible damage with their blows.[3]\nSuperhuman Stamina\nSuperhuman Durability: Martians possess high levels of durability that make them nigh-invulnerable to all forms of damage. Martians can withstand high caliber bullets, powerful energy blast and kinetic impacts without suffering damage.[4]\nSuperhuman Speed: Martians can process thoughts, move, and react at incredible speed, being able to cover vast distances in little or no time, catch bullets in mid flight, run on water and create afterimages as they run.[5]\nSuperhuman Agility\nSuperhuman Reflexes\nRegeneration: Martians have powerful regenerative powers that enable them to regenerate their entire body from a severed limb, they can furtherly enhance their regenerative powers by drawing mass from nearby sources.[6]\nFlight[2]\nExtrasensory Input\nLongevity[6]\nSuper Hearing[6]\nHeat Vision[7]\nMartian Vision: Martian visual acuity greatly exceed human norms and allows for a wider range of information to be observed. This includes the following:[2]\nInfared Vision[citation needed]\nX-Ray Vision[8]\nElectro-Magnetic Spectrum Vision[citation needed]\nTelescopic Vision[9]\nMicroscopic Vision[citation needed]\nTelepathy: Martians have the ability to read the minds of others and project their thoughts to varying degrees. They can also project their mental essences into a gestalt community known as the \"Great Mind\". Through this, the community can enhance the telepathic strength of other Martians. This power can also enable them to reverse the effects of amnesia or psychological brainwashing. [2]\nIllusions\nPossession\nAstral Projection\nMind Control: As an extension of this, Martians can also use the ability to alter a psychological profile of a target, enabling them to manipulate, and in some cases, outright control that individual. This practice is greatly discouraged however, and only rarely used. [10]\nTelepathic Relay[10]\nTelepathic Assault\nTelekinesis[11]: Martians have mind-over-matter abilities and can lift and move objects with their minds. They can also employ their telekinesis in offensive way by discharging telekinetic blasts capable of great concussive power.[12]",

Although affecting only one target at a time, its radiation, even at a distance, is lethal to humans in the long term. It was responsible for the first Black Canary's death from cancer years after their fight.[1] It depletes Cosmic Rod's energy, which will be only restored after one week; all other effects from his powers will be cancelled, including banished persons with dimensional travel.\nDimensional Travel: In possession of the Cosmic Rod, Aquarius had significant power to banish Earth's population from the Earth-Two universe.

  "Powers": "Kryptonian Physiology: Under the effects of a \"yellow\" sun, Az-Rel possesses the same potential powers as an average Kryptonian. These include:\nSolar Energy Absorption: Under optimal conditions, this is the main source of Az-Rel's super powers as they are contingent upon exposure to solar radiation from a yellow sun star system. His biological make up includes a number of organs which lack analogues in humans and whose functions are unknown. It is believed that between one or more of these and his bio-cellular matrix, \"yellow\" solar energy is stored for later use. This allows for the use of these powers to fade when yellow solar radiation is not available instead of immediate failure.\nHeat Vision: Az-Rel can, as a conscious act, fire beams of intense heat at a target by looking at it. He can vary the heat and area affected.\nSuper-Hearing: Az-Rel's hearing is sensitive enough to hear any sound at any volume or pitch. With skill and concentration, he can block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source or frequency.\nEnhanced Vision: Az-Rel's vision processes the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as allowing vast control over selective perception and focus.This umbrella ability includes the following:\nElectromagnetic Spectrum Vision: Az-Rel can see well into most of the electromagnetic spectrum. He can see and identify radio and television signals as well as all other broadcast or transmitted frequencies. Using this ability, he can avoid detection by radar or satellite monitoring methods. This also allows him to see the aura generated by living thing.\nTelescopic Vision: This is the ability to see something at a great distance, without violating the laws of physics. Though limited, the exact extent of the ability is undetermined. In function, it is similar to the zoom lens on a camera.\nX-Ray Vision: This is the ability to see through any volume of matter except lead. Az-Rels can see things behind a solid, opaque object as if it were not there. He can focus this ability to \"peel back\" layers of an object, allowing hidden image or inner workings to be observed. The exact type of energy perceived—such as x-rays, cosmic rays, or some other energy invisible to normal humans—is unclear. This ability perceives an ambient energy source though, it does not involve the eye projecting a concentrated, possibly toxic, beam to be reflected back from objects.\nMicroscopic Vision: This is the ability to see extremely small objects and images down to the atomic level.\nInfrared Vision: Az-Rel can see with better acuity in darkness, and to a degree in total darkness.\nFlight: Az-Rel is able to manipulate graviton particles to defy the forces of gravity and achieve flight. This ranges from hovering to moving in any posture, in any direction.\nInvulnerability: Due to the interaction of his dense molecular structure and supercharged bio-electric aura, Az-Rel is nigh-invulnerable to extreme energy forces. In addition, his extends this protection against toxins and diseases.\nSuperhuman Stamina: Az-Rel is able to maintain continuous strenuous physical action for an indefinite period of time. This based on his body converting yellow solar radiation directly to energy, but is limited by physiological and psychological needs to eat, drink, and sleep.\nSuperhuman Strength: Az-Rel's strength is augmented by yellow solar radiation interacting with the greater than human density, resilience and biological efficiency of his musculature. His strength is more an act of conscious will on energy fields than actual physical strength. It is this act of conscious will that enables him to perform physical feats that are beyond the mere application force, such as moving a mountain top without said rock crumbling under its own mass.\nSuperhuman Speed: Az-Rel is able to move at incredible speed by sheer force of will. This extends to his perceptions and allows for feats such as catching bullets in mid flight as well as covering vast distances in little or no time.This also confers:\nSuperhuman Agility\nSuperhuman Reflexes\nSuper-Breath: Az-Rel is able to create hurricane force winds by exhaling air from his lungs. He can chill the air as it leaves his lungs to freeze targets. He can also reverse the process to pull large volumes of air or vapor into his  lungs.\nLongevity: Az-Rel can live longer than regular humans, remaining at his prime as long as he was under the exposure of the \"yellow\" sun.",

After her tryst with the witch Circe, Barbara could willingly change to and back from human form and animal form at will.\nSuperhuman Strength: As an avatar of a god, Cheetah possesses great strength.\nSuperhuman Durability: Cheetah's physical durability is enough to withstand blows from the likes of Wonder Woman and Superman. Cheetah's durability doesn't protect her from bullets, lasers, or other piercing attacks.\nSuperhuman Speed: Cheetah possesses greater speed than Wonder Woman, enhanced even further by training with Zoom.[6] When Cheetah over came her psychological blocks, she managed to acquire her true speed.[6][7]\nSuperhuman Agility: Cheetah's agility is enhanced far beyond normal human levels.\nEnhanced Senses: Cheetah's senses are a lot more powerful than a normal human.\nClaws and Fangs: Cheetah's claws and fangs are enchanted and allow her to cut almost anything.

  "Powers": "Enhanced Brain Activity: Deathstroke volunteered for the Enhanced Soldier Initiative, an experimental procedure that activated a dormant metagene, which evolved his brain. This greatly enhanced Slade's mental capacity, causing his mind to operate at peak efficiency, nine times beyond that of a normal man.[25] Deathstroke's evolved mind also allows him to access his brain functions on a cellular level, granting him enhanced physical attributes.[26][27]\nAccelerated Healing: Deathstroke possesses a greatly accelerated healing rate. His rapid healing clots blood in seconds and seals wounds in minutes. The time it takes for full healing depends upon the wound, ranging from seconds to hours, depending on the level of injury.[4] It was stated he would be able to heal from breaking every bone in his body in a matter of hours.[28] Deathstroke can heal quick enough to allow him to survive fatal wounds, such as being impaled by a sword.[21] He was also able to heal from third degree burns over 90 percent of his body.[24]\nDecelerated Aging: Deathstroke's healing ability also supplies him with a nearly-ageless lifespan.[29] Due to this ability, Slade is 57 years old, but appears 35.[6]\nResurrection: Deathstroke is unable to survive a lethal injury to the brain, however it is possible for his healing factor to go into overdrive after he has died, if his immune system is triggered by an infection. This allowed Slade to come back to life after being shot in the head.[24]\nToxic Immunity: Deathstroke's regenerative healing provides him with a enhanced immunity to toxins. When exposed to a dangerous paralyzation toxin, it only slowed Slade from superhuman levels, to that of a normal human, rather than instantly paralyze him.[30]\nEnhanced Senses: Deathstroke's senses are far more heightened than those of a normal human,[31] to the extent that he can feel slight shifts in the air.[32] While temporarily blinded, Deathstroke was able to easily fight and maneuver around a large complex, due to his heightened senses.[33]\nEnhanced Hearing[5]\nEnhanced Sense of Smell[30]\nEnhanced Vision[34]\nSuperhuman Agility: Deathstroke's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to superhuman levels, allowing him to easily evade rapid gunfire.[17]\nSuperhuman Durability: Deathstroke is capable of resisting tremendous kinetic impact forces that could easily crush or kill a human, without suffering any serious external or internal injuries. He has withstood hits from vastly strong opponents, including Wonder Woman,[35] Superman and Lapetus.[36]\nSuperhuman Reflexes: Deathstroke's reflexes far superior to a normal human. He is able to easily react to and dodge point-blank gunfire, as well as catch arrows[17] and daggers and thrown at him from behind, without looking.[31]\nSuperhuman Speed: Deathstroke is capable of moving at speeds greater than the finest human athlete,[22] quick enough to tag Reverse Flash.[37] Even Flash considers Deathstroke to be fast.[19]\nSuperhuman Stamina: Deathstroke can exert himself for long periods of time, without tiring easily and while wearing heavy body armor. He has exerted himself for days on multiple occasions.[38] During the \"War of Jokes and Riddles\", Deathstroke exerted himself for 5 days and 5 nights.[10]\nSuperhuman Strength: Deathstroke's natural strength has been augmented to superhuman levels.[32] He is strong enough to easily snap a sword in half,[31] overpower normal humans, throw others several feet with one arm,[32] as well as lift and throw a large piece of concrete.[39]\nSuper-Leaping: Due to his superhuman strength, Deathstroke is able to leap incredible distances from a standing position, far greater than any normal human could.[40]",
  "Description": "Slade Wilson, known by his codename, Deathstroke, is an elite mercenary, commonly considered the world's greatest and deadliest assassin. The only contract he has ever failed to fulfill was one against the Teen Titans.[4] He considers the role of Deathstroke a job, not a reflection of who he is. Most of the rumors about him are true, and he doesn't mind, because he loves his job. As far as he is concerned, Slade Wilson is a good man - an adventurer.[5]\n",

  "Powers": "Venom Usage: Bane's use of the Super-steroid Venom allowed him to temporarily enhance his physical functions to superhuman levels, particularly his strength, endurance, and speed. His body's senses and healing abilities are also augmented to a degree. Bane needs to periodically inject himself with Venom to retain these abilities, although overuse can result in temporary insanity.\nSuperhuman Strength: The primary effect of Venom is that it enhances strength to low superhuman levels, depending on how much venom is injected. Bane has been shown to be stronger than Batman even without the Venom, and while injected is able to bend thick steel. When Bane injects the maximum amount of Venom that is considered healthy into himself, he becomes capable of lifting about 2 tons. He is ultimately capable of exceeding his limit to 3 tons, though not without temporarily losing control over himself.\nEnhanced Reflexes: Under the effects of Venom, Bane can react just as fast as the fittest human can. Bane has fought many opponents while applying his tactics and supporting his massive frame.\nEnhanced Speed: Under the effects of Venom, Bane can run as fast as the fittest human can. Running on par with Olympic runners, Bane can support his weight while maintaining a high rate of speed.\nSuperhuman Stamina: Under the effects of Venom, Bane can fight almost forever. As long as he can continue to pump Venom into his veins he can continue fighting indefinitely. While on a single dose of venom Bane has fought many battles for many hours and never seemingly stopped.\nSuperhuman Durability: Under the effects of Venom, Bane can withstand powerful blows from metahumans, multiple bullets and explosions. With mere scratches and bruises Bane has withstood extreme torment at the hands of his enemies.\nAccelerated Healing: Bane can also use his Venom as a form of medicine to heal from injuries, poisons and diseases. Depending on how devastating the injury, Bane needs to inject a certain amount of Venom into himself. When faced with extreme wounds, such as many broken bones, excessive blood loss, or terminal poisons or diseases, Bane needs to inject an unhealthy amount of venom which will cause him to temporarily go berserk in order to heal properly.",

The Pits are partially made up of the chemical compound Dionesium, which has the supernatural ability to revive dead tissue, bringing those who encounter it back to life.[3] As a side effect of exposure to the pit, Ra's temporarily endures a \"Lazarus Fever\". This causes him to break out into uncontrollable rage, temporarily enhancing his physical attributes.[4]\nImmortality: Ra's has acquired an extended lifespan through the use of the Lazarus Pit. His unrestricted access to the Pit has rendered him nearly immortal.\nToxic Immunity: Ra's' immortality has made him immune to the effects of toxins, such as Scarecrow's Fear Toxin.[citation needed]\nMagic: Ra's is able to use magic spells for various purposes. He was taught by Giovanni Zatara to invoke magic by speaking backwards. He has used this type of magic to erase memories from Batman's mind on multiple instances.[2][5]\nNecromancy: Ra's has been shown capable of utilizing magic to summon the dead. On one occasion Ra's used a spell to resurrect Solomon Grundy.[6]\nResurrection[6]\nPower Absorption: When the Lazarus Pit's effect began to fade, Ra's was able to absorb Solomon Grundy's immortality through a spell.[6]",
