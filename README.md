# Project description:
The purpose of this project is to create a full stack MERN (Mongo-Express-React-Node) application that will allow a user to send server requests through interaction with React components. I used the axios npm package to perform request methods like GET, POST, and DELETE. The server is set up using Express.js, and the database used is MongoDB. Users will be able to view a list of DC Characters.
Users will be able to make their own (encrypted) login, search for books by sending a GET request to the Google Books API and returning response data, and save (or delete) books to a database using a one:many relationship.

## What to Expect From the Application
DC Comics/Universe does not have their own dedicated API. So I created my own using a WebScrapper to scrap data and stored it to a Mongo Database.
